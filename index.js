// This is where the main code for the aiRider app would go
// It would use the other modules and libraries to implement the functionality of the app
// Example code:
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');

app.listen(port, () => {

});
